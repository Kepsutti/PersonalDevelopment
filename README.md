## Purpose of this repository
I'm starting this project with the initial goal of learning to use Unity's UI Toolkit, and with the long term goal of expanding it to include multiple simple recreations of common game concepts spanning a range of varying genres. The purpose is to familiarize myself with a broader scope of game programming and giving myself ample opportunity to create a wide range of different types of UI using the UI Toolkit. I may eventually dip my toe into making actual graphics too, but for now I'm concentrating on the technical side of development.

## Current state of the project
This project is still very much in its infancy, only consisting of a main menu with some transition animations made entirely with UI Toolkit.
My roadmap is as follows:
1. Refactor and polish main menu
2. Create a second menu which consists of a selection window for the simple games to come
3. Create the first mini game
4. Profit
